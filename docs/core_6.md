* <a id="n_min_grid">**n_min_grid**</a> - **Integer** larger **0**
	* Sets the number of grid values; the default is 1; if **n_min_grid** equals 1, **n_min_min** is used for leaf size.

	* Sets value to further specify the utilized penalty function in combination with *mce_vart*; if *mce_vart* is 0, the *p_diff_penalty* is irrelevant; if  *mce_vart* is 1, for the default value of None or -1 the multiplier of the penalty is computed as follows $2((no^{train} \times \text{subsample share} )^{0.9})/(no^{train}\times \text{subsample share})\times(\text{no of treatments} \times(\text{no of treatments}-1)/2)^{0.5}$; if the balancing tests indicate bad balance, you should increase the penalty above the default. If *mce_vart* is 2, the penalty is set by the program as follows: for the default value of None or -1, the penalty is $200((no^{train} \times \text{subsample share} )^{0.9})/(no^{train}\times \text{subsample share})\times(\text{no of treatments} \times(\text{no of treatments}-1)/2)^{0.5}$; increase the penalty if balancing tests indicate bad balance. If the value is set to 0, there is no penalty; if *mce_vart* is equal to 3, by default the probability of setting the p-score is 0.5; if the specified probability is larger $1$, the program checks if the user-defined probability has been accidentally scaled in percent and rescales the number to obtain valid scores in the zero-one interval.
